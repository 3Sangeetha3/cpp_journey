/*
->We store the address of each childâ€™s class Rectangle and Square object in s and
->Then we call the get_Area() function on it,
->Ideally, it should have called the respective get_Area() functions of the child classes but
->Instead, it calls the get_Area() defined in the base class.
->This happens due to static linkage which means the call to get_Area() is getting set only once by the compiler which is in the base class.


=> i cannot print the get_Area output i.e; 25 & 8 without using virtual function in the pointer concept
=> If you want to calculate the area of shapes without using a virtual function, you can call the get_Area() function directly on the objects instead of through a pointer to the base class.
    i.e;ob1.get_Area();, ob2.get_Area();
